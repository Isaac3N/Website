        <h3>
            <p> Hi, I am Isaac Ndubuisi a Python Developer.This article was written to give you a basic understnding of the python language
                and everything you would need to know in other to get to work on python. So without further adieu, lets get started.  </p>
                <p>Python is one of the strongest languages out there to learn with countless of frameworks and tons of flexibility <br> making it one of the
                    most sort out language out there. <br> It is easy to learn making it one of the best languages a beginner programmer can start with. <br>
                It was created Guido Van Rossum in 1990. The language is used in so many aspects of computings such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Web development, Machine learning, Ethical hacking etc .<br>
                Python has a lot of aspects to cover such as Built-in <a href="#data type">Data types</a>(Numbers, Strings, boolean and Conditional Statements(if, else, elif) , <a href="#tuples">Tuples</a>, <a href="#lists">Lists</a>, <a href="#dictionaries">Dictionaries</a>,<a href="#loops">Loops </a>( For loop, While Loops),<a href="#functions">Functions</a>, <a href="#double Op">Double-OP</a>  etc <br>

                <center><u><a id="data type"><b>DATA TYPES</b> </a></u></center> <br>
                <p>In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things. <br>
                    Python has the following data types built-in by default. </p> <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>BOOLEANS: They express values in terms of True(1) or False(0). for example: print(10 > 9) returns True because 10 is greater than 9</li>
                        <li>STRINGS: In Python, strings are ordered sequences of character data, and thus can be indexed in this way. They are immutable so they cant be changed.</li>
                        <li>VARIABLES: Variablles are objects in which data is assigned to for future referral </li>
                        <li>NUMBERS: Number Data Type in Python. Python supports integers, floating-point numbers and complex numbers. <br>
                            They are defined as int, float, and complex classes in Python. <br>
                            Integers and floating points are separated by the presence or absence of a decimal point. <br>
                            For instance, 5 is an integer whereas 5.0 is a floating-point number.</li>
                    </ol>

                <center><u><a id="tuples"><b> TUPLES</b></a></u></center>
                <P>A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets. <br>
                    EXAMPLE: thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
                    print(thistuple) <br>
                    </P>
                <hr>
                <center><u><a id="lists"><b>LISTS</b></a></u></center>
                <P>A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets. <br>
                    Example: thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                    print(thislist) </P>
                    
                <hr>
                <center><u><a id="dictionaries"><b>DICTIONARIES</b></a></u></center>
                <p>A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. <br> 
                In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values. <br>
                    this_dict = { <br>
                    "brand": "Lamborghini", <br>
                    "model": "Urus", <br>
                    "year": 2019 <br>
                    }
                    print(this_dict)</p>

                    <center><u><b><a id="loops">LOOPS</a> </b></u></center>
                    <P>A loop is a structure, series, or process, the end of which is connected to the beginning. <br>
                        They are two main loops in python the while loop and the for loop</P>
                        <ol>
                            <li>WHILE LOOPS:In python, while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given a condition is satisfied. <br>
                                And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in program is executed.</li>
                                Example:count = 0 <br>
                                while (count < 3):  <br>   
                                    count = count + 1 <br>
                                    print("Hello Geek") <br>

                                    <u>Output:</u> <br>
                                    Hello Geek <br>
                                    Hello Geek <br>
                                    Hello Geek <br>
                                    <hr>
                            <li>FOR LOOPS:For loops are used for sequential traversal. For example: traversing a list or string or array etc. </li>
                        </ol>

                    <P>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.</P>

                    <P>Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
                        A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</P>
